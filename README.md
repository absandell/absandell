# About Me
I am a 4th Year Computer Science and Economics Double Major at the University of Florida. I have worked since January 2021 as a Data Privacy and Protection Intern at Axogen. Additionally, I worked with Infotech during Summer 2021 as a Software Engineering Intern.

My areas of interest lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics - primarily by finding creative ways to use data to solve complex problems. I have also picked up web-development, VR App Design, and Cybersecurity as other areas of interest. Additionally, I have a passion for econometric analysis and many of my side projects are related to using Machine Learning and Algorithms to optimize financial trading.
